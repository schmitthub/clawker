# Clawker

Clawker is a container orchestration and automation tool for running [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents in isolated Docker environments. It wraps Docker with security, convenience, and multi-agent features so you can run autonomous coding agents safely on any machine with Docker installed.

## What Clawker Does

- **Isolated agent environments** — Each Claude Code agent runs in its own Docker container with configurable security controls
- **Embedded Dockerfile template** — Parameterized images with common dev tools preinstalled, supporting Alpine or Debian bases
- **Bind or snapshot workspaces** — Mount your repo for live editing, or copy it for pure isolation
- **Seamless credential forwarding** — SSH agent, GPG agent, and Git HTTPS credentials forwarded from your host
- **Default-on firewall** — Blocks outbound traffic except allowlisted domains (GitHub, package registries)
- **Project-scoped namespacing** — Multi-agent, multi-project isolation via Docker labels and naming conventions
- **Git worktree integration** — Spin up agents on separate branches with automatic worktree management
- **Monitoring stack** — Optional Prometheus + Loki + Grafana for real-time agent observability
- **Autonomous loop mode** — Run Claude Code in iterative loops with stagnation detection and circuit breakers

## How It Works

Clawker sits between your CLI and Docker, adding a security and convenience layer:

```
You (CLI) → Clawker → pkg/whail (label-isolated Docker engine) → Docker SDK → Docker
```

Every container, volume, network, and image created by Clawker is tagged with `dev.clawker.*` labels. Clawker only sees and manages its own resources — it cannot touch anything outside its label scope.
