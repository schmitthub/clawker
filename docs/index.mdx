# Clawker

AI coding agents are powerful but risky to run directly on your machine -- they can read sensitive files, make network calls, and modify your system. Clawker solves this by running [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents in isolated Docker containers with security controls, credential forwarding, and multi-agent orchestration built in.

## What Is an Agent?

In Clawker, an **agent** is a named container instance running Claude Code. Each agent gets its own isolated environment with its own filesystem, network, and credentials. You can run multiple agents per project (e.g., `--agent dev`, `--agent review`) and they operate independently.

```bash
clawker run -it --agent dev @     # Start a "dev" agent
clawker run -it --agent review @  # Start a "review" agent in parallel
```

## What Clawker Does

- **Default-on firewall** -- Blocks outbound traffic except allowlisted domains (Anthropic APIs, package registries). Your agent can't phone home to unexpected endpoints.
- **Seamless credential forwarding** -- SSH agent, GPG agent, and Git HTTPS credentials forwarded from your host. No manual key copying.
- **Isolated agent environments** -- Each Claude Code agent runs in its own Docker container with configurable security controls
- **Bind or snapshot workspaces** -- Mount your repo for live editing, or copy it for pure isolation
- **Embedded Dockerfile template** -- Parameterized images with common dev tools preinstalled, supporting Alpine or Debian bases
- **Project-scoped namespacing** -- Multi-agent, multi-project isolation via Docker labels and naming conventions
- **Git worktree integration** -- Spin up agents on separate branches with automatic worktree management
- **Autonomous loop mode** -- Run Claude Code in iterative loops with stagnation detection and circuit breakers
- **Monitoring stack** -- Optional Prometheus + Loki + Grafana for real-time agent observability

## How It Works

Clawker sits between your CLI and Docker, adding a security and convenience layer:

```
You (CLI) -> Clawker -> pkg/whail (label-isolated Docker engine) -> Docker SDK -> Docker
```

Every container, volume, network, and image created by Clawker is tagged with `dev.clawker.*` labels. Clawker only sees and manages its own resources -- it cannot touch anything outside its label scope.
