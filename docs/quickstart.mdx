## Prerequisites

- **Docker** must be installed and running on your machine
- An **Anthropic API key** or Claude subscription for Claude Code

## Install Clawker

<CodeGroup>
```bash Homebrew
brew install schmitthub/tap/clawker
```

```bash curl
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
</CodeGroup>

## Initialize Clawker

```bash
clawker init
```

This creates the Clawker directory structure (`~/.config/clawker/` for settings, `~/.local/share/clawker/` for data, `~/.local/state/clawker/` for logs) and prompts you to build a default fallback image.

## Start a Project

```bash
cd your-project
clawker project init    # Creates clawker.yaml, .clawkerignore, registers project
clawker build           # Builds your project's Docker image
```

## Run Your First Agent

An **agent** is a named container instance running Claude Code. The `--agent` flag gives it a name so you can manage multiple agents per project (e.g., `dev`, `review`, `refactor`).

```bash
clawker run -it --agent dev @
```

<Tip>
The `@` shortcut resolves to your project's built image (`clawker-<project>:latest`). It saves you from typing the full image name every time.
</Tip>

This creates and attaches to a new Claude Code agent running in an isolated container.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Interact with Claude Code">
    You're now inside a containerized Claude Code session. Work as you normally would — your code is mounted, credentials forwarded, and the firewall is active.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detach without stopping">
    Press `Ctrl+P`, then `Ctrl+Q` to detach from the container while keeping it running.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-attach later">
    ```bash
    clawker attach --agent dev
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop the agent">
    Exit Claude Code with `/exit`, or from another terminal:
    ```bash
    clawker stop --agent dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
