## Prerequisites

- **Docker** must be installed and running
- macOS is the primary supported platform; Linux should also work
- Windows is not currently supported

## Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install schmitthub/tap/clawker
```

## Install Script

Downloads a pre-built binary from GitHub releases. No Go toolchain required.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Options

Pin a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | CLAWKER_VERSION=v0.1.3 bash
```

Install to a custom directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | CLAWKER_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin bash
```

## Build from Source

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schmitthub/clawker.git
cd clawker && make clawker
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
clawker version
```

## First-Time Setup

After installing, initialize Clawker:

```bash
clawker init
```

This creates the `~/.local/clawker/` directory structure with:
- Logs directory
- User settings (`settings.yaml`)
- Project registry (`projects.yaml`)
- Optional default fallback image build
