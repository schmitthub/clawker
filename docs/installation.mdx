## Prerequisites

- **Docker** must be installed and running
- macOS is the primary supported platform; Linux should also work
- Windows is not currently supported

## Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install schmitthub/tap/clawker
```

## Install Script

Downloads a pre-built binary from GitHub releases. No Go toolchain required.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Options

Pin a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | CLAWKER_VERSION=v0.1.3 bash
```

Install to a custom directory:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmitthub/clawker/main/scripts/install.sh | CLAWKER_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin bash
```

## Build from Source

Requires Go 1.25+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schmitthub/clawker.git
cd clawker && make clawker
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
clawker version
```

## First-Time Setup

After installing, initialize Clawker:

```bash
clawker init
```

This creates the Clawker directory structure following the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/):

| Directory | Default Path | Contents |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Config | `~/.config/clawker/` | `settings.yaml`, `projects.yaml` |
| Data | `~/.local/share/clawker/` | Build cache, worktree metadata |
| State | `~/.local/state/clawker/` | Log files, PID files |

It also prompts you to build a default fallback image.
