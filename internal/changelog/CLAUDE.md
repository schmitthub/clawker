# internal/changelog

Fetches the curated, hand-maintained `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format)
and surfaces the entries gained since the show-once cursor. The package owns the
cursor lifecycle end to end — read, first-run seed, and advance all live here,
backed by `internal/state`.

The single exported entry point is `CheckForChanges` (`changelog.go`, alongside
`Entry` and the `between` range query); `Entry` is the parsed unit. The parser
(`parse.go`) and the cursor range query (`between`) are pure, unexported
helpers — nothing outside the package composes them independently.

There is **no on-disk cache and no TTL**: the curated changelog is small,
best-effort, and the CLI runs on the host where it is always online, so each
non-first run fetches fresh. Callers treat any error as "no changelog to show".

This is the curated changelog: the root `CHANGELOG.md` covers only the handful
of releases that change the user surface, not every tech-debt or dependency
bump. The exhaustive per-commit list lives in each GitHub release's "Commits"
section (GoReleaser).

## CHANGELOG.md format

Plain [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) — no clawker-specific
metadata. A release is a set of changes spanning many PRs, so it carries no
single classifying kind or headline: the whole section body is the unit.

```markdown
## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **User-configurable command aliases.** ... [Docs](https://docs.clawker.dev/aliases)

### Fixed

- **Alias expansion order.** ...
```

- **Version header**: `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`. The bracketed token must be a
  full `x.y.z` semver (tolerating a leading `v`). `parseVersionHeader` validates
  it with `semver.StrictNewVersion`, which rejects both a non-semver like
  `[Unreleased]` and a partial like `[0.12]` — those sections are **skipped**
  (never yield an entry). Authored newest-first.
- **Body**: everything between the version header and the next version header
  (or the trailing link-reference block), preserved as markdown — every
  `### Added/Fixed/Changed/...` subsection of the release, its bullets, and any
  inline links. The teaser renders the body as markdown; there is no per-release
  kind or title.
- **Links**: relevant docs go inline in the bullets (`[Docs](<url>)`).
- **HTML comments** (`<!-- ... -->` on their own line) are stripped from the
  body so they never render (including any legacy `<!-- clawker: -->` line). The
  `[x.y.z]: <url>` link-reference block never leaks into a body either.

## API

```go
type Entry struct {
    Version string // "0.12.2" (bare, no v) — semver anchor
    Date    string // "2026-06-11"
    Body    string // the Keep-a-Changelog markdown body (### sections + bullets), rendered verbatim
}

// CheckForChanges owns the show-once cursor end to end. The caller supplies the
// *http.Client (the Factory's HttpClient noun in production; an internal/httpmock
// stub in tests).
func CheckForChanges(ctx context.Context, client *http.Client, st state.StateStore, current string) ([]Entry, error)

const ChangelogURL string // raw CHANGELOG.md on main (consts.RawGitHubBaseURL + consts.GitHubRepo); a const, not a test seam — the injected client's transport is the seam
```

`CheckForChanges` behavior:

- **`st == nil`** → **error** (a programming error: the caller wires state via the
  factory). It is not a silent no-op.
- **First run** — the cursor (`st.State().LastSeenChangelog`) is empty or does not
  parse as a version → seed the cursor at `current` and return `nil` **without
  fetching**. There is **no catch-up backfill** across a changelog-blind
  upgrade; the cursor is "last seen" from here on.
- **Otherwise** → GET `ChangelogURL` with the supplied client (context-aware,
  bounded by the client's own timeout, non-200 is an error), `parse`, return the
  entries in `(cursor, current]` via `between` (newest-first, cursor-exclusive /
  current-inclusive), and advance the cursor to `current`.

There is **no `persist` gate**: `CheckForChanges` is only ever called on a
non-suppressed run, so it always seeds/advances the cursor. (Suppression — non-
TTY / CI / opt-out — is decided by the caller, which simply does not call
`CheckForChanges` on a suppressed run.) The cursor write is best-effort — a write
failure is returned (with any gained entries) for the caller to log.

The cursor is stored via `current.String()` (canonical bare semver, e.g.
`0.12.0`) at **both** store sites — the first-run seed and the advance — so a
`v`-prefixed `current` (`v0.12.0`) still lands as bare `0.12.0` at rest.

`current` is the raw running-binary version **string**: the caller
(`internal/clawker` `Main`) passes `build.Version` directly and imports no semver
— `CheckForChanges` owns parsing it (v-tolerant), exactly as it parses the cursor
string out of state. An unparseable `current` — a non-release `"DEV"` build —
returns an error, so the caller logs and shows nothing (no separate DEV gate). An
unparseable cursor in state is treated as a first run.

## Semver

Version handling uses `github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3` directly (no internal
semver wrapper): `StrictNewVersion` for the header gate, `NewVersion` (coercing,
v-tolerant) + `(*Version).Compare` for the cursor and `between` bounds.

## Dependencies

`internal/state` (cursor read/seed/advance), `github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3`,
stdlib `net/http`. No on-disk cache, no clock, no Factory noun.

## Testing

- `changelog_test.go` — pure parser table tests against `testdata/CHANGELOG.md`:
  header parsing, `## [Unreleased]` + partial-header skip (guards
  `StrictNewVersion`), body preservation across a multi-kind release (Added +
  Fixed both survive) with inline links intact, HTML-comment + link-reference
  stripping.
- `checkforchanges_test.go` — `CheckForChanges` over an `internal/httpmock`
  registry (`reg.Client()` injected; `len(reg.Requests)` is the request-hit
  counter) + a real isolated store (`testenv.New(t)` + `state.New()`): the cursor
  is seeded as a
  **raw string** (prod parses it), so the range table, the
  first-run-seeds-no-fetch path, the **garbage-cursor → first-run** failure
  branch, always-advances, the **`String()` canonical-cursor** assertion (a
  `v0.12.0` current stored as `0.12.0` at both the seed and advance sites),
  the **nil-state error**, and fetch-error-no-advance all run through the real
  entry point. The range logic is **not** unit-tested in isolation — proving it
  through `CheckForChanges` keeps the cursor parse (prod's job) on the wire.
