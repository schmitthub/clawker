  # Future: Integration test jobs will be added here.
  # Use `needs: [security, lint, test]` so integration tests only run
  # after fast checks pass (saves runner minutes on obvious failures).
  # Planned jobs (matching Makefile targets):
  #   test-commands, test-internals, test-acceptance, test-whail, test-agents
