**Planned features and fixes**
- Linux support (untested)
- Windows support
- Versioning and releases with CI/CD integration
- Auto pruning to manage disk usage
- Man pages and helper docs
- Docker MCP Toolkit support (currently a known “feature-not-a-bug”: MCP plugin inside a container doesn’t detect Docker Desktop)
- Host proxy browser auth: re-attach before authenticating can break the flow (low priority)
- Grafana pre-built dashboard improvements (currently basic POC)
- Improved host Claude directory mounting strategy to avoid permission issues and settings
