**Key Learnings**:
  - Channel-based methods like `ContainerWait` need goroutines to wrap SDK errors
  - Test helper functions should not be duplicated across test files in same package
  - `IsContainerManaged` silently returns `(false, nil)` for not-found - document this behavior
  - Cobra shows parent commands without subcommands under "Additional help topics"
  - Once subcommands are added, they move to "Available Commands"
  - Commands use positional args for container names (Docker-like)
  - Helper function `splitArgs` shared across test files in same package
  - Commands use `internal/docker.Client` instead of legacy `internal/engine`
  - Terminal visual state (alternate screen buffer, cursor visibility, text attributes) is separate from termios mode. `term.Restore()` sends ANSI escape sequences (`\x1b[?1049l\x1b[?25h\x1b[0m\x1b(B`) to reset visual state before restoring termios after container detach/exit.
  - Never bypass whail - scaffold with TODO if method missing
  - Stats streaming requires goroutines for concurrent container stat collection
  - Memory size parsing needs case-insensitive suffix handling
  - Cobra interprets args starting with `-` as flags; use `--` separator or avoid such test inputs
  - exec command must check container is running before creating exec instance
  - cp command uses tar archives for file transfer; handle both copy directions
  - attach command detects container TTY from ContainerInspect
  - Subcommands go in their own subpackages (volume/list/list.go not volume/list.go)
  - shlex.Split strips quotes, so test expected values shouldn't include quotes
  - prune workaround: list+remove individual volumes instead of waiting for VolumesPrune
  - Global flag `-D/--debug` reserves `-D` shorthand; don't reuse it in subcommands
  - VolumesPrune needs `all=true` filter to prune named volumes (Docker default only prunes anonymous)
  - Test ordering matters: tests that remove resources affect later tests using same resources
  - TestImageRemove must create its own image, not reuse testImageTag that other tests need
  - Container create/run reuse buildConfigs for Docker config construction
  - Run command must handle both TTY and non-TTY I/O with proper channel selection
  - Test slices: GetStringArray returns empty slice not nil; use helper to compare nil==[]
  - Docker SDK ImageBuildOptions does not have Platform field; SDK version determines available fields
  - Alias pattern for Cobra: create thin wrapper that calls underlying command and overrides Examples
  - StringArray flags for multi-value inputs (--tag, --build-arg, --label) need parsing to maps
  - Label merging: user labels first, then clawker labels (clawker takes precedence)
  - Build args support KEY without value (nil pointer) for env passthrough
  - Deprecated flags: use MarkHidden + MarkDeprecated for backward compatibility
  - Host proxy pattern: HTTP server on localhost, containers connect via host.docker.internal
  - Host proxy enables container-to-host actions like opening URLs in browser
  - Factory pattern for hostproxy: lazy init with sync.Once, EnsureRunning() before container commands
  - BROWSER env var set to /usr/local/bin/host-open so CLI tools use host proxy automatically
  - Terminal attach TUI redraw: Use Docker CLI's +1/-1 resize trick to force redraw. Resize to (height+1, width+1) then back to (height, width) - this forces SIGWINCH and triggers TUI redraw. See docker/cli attach.go resizeTTY(). Implemented in StreamWithResize.
