**Key Learnings**:
  - Channel-based methods like `ContainerWait` need goroutines to wrap SDK errors
  - Test helper functions should not be duplicated across test files in same package
  - `IsContainerManaged` silently returns `(false, nil)` for not-found - document this behavior
  - Cobra shows parent commands without subcommands under "Additional help topics"
  - Once subcommands are added, they move to "Available Commands"
  - Commands use positional args for container names (Docker-like)
  - Helper function `splitArgs` shared across test files in same package
  - Commands use `internal/docker.Client` instead of legacy `internal/engine`
  - Top-level project commands (run, stop, logs) are NOT shortcuts to management commands
  - They have different semantics (project-based with --agent vs container-name-based)
  - Never bypass whail - scaffold with TODO if method missing
  - Stats streaming requires goroutines for concurrent container stat collection
  - Memory size parsing needs case-insensitive suffix handling
  - Cobra interprets args starting with `-` as flags; use `--` separator or avoid such test inputs
  - Global flags like `-d` (--debug) conflict with command-specific flags; avoid reusing shorthands
  - exec command must check container is running before creating exec instance
  - cp command uses tar archives for file transfer; handle both copy directions
  - attach command detects container TTY from ContainerInspect
  - Subcommands go in their own subpackages (volume/list/list.go not volume/list.go)
  - shlex.Split strips quotes, so test expected values shouldn't include quotes
  - prune workaround: list+remove individual volumes instead of waiting for VolumesPrune
  - Global flag `-d/--debug` reserves `-d` shorthand; don't reuse it in subcommands
  - VolumesPrune needs `all=true` filter to prune named volumes (Docker default only prunes anonymous)
  - Test ordering matters: tests that remove resources affect later tests using same resources
  - TestImageRemove must create its own image, not reuse testImageTag that other tests need
  - Container create/run reuse buildConfigs for Docker config construction
  - Run command must handle both TTY and non-TTY I/O with proper channel selection
  - Test slices: GetStringArray returns empty slice not nil; use helper to compare nil==[]
